The initial author of the code is [Michael Sinz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelsinz) The Author has not included any license terms in the code-base, hence it is uncertain what license the software is distributed under

I have tried to reach out to him but have not had any response. I would recommend that he use [CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode) to distribute this code-base.
