              The following test pages are to test if your browser is compatible with the
              Insurrection Web Tools for Subversion.&nbsp; Where ever possible, the tests have
              been broken out into individual situations such that the core issues can be
              identified.&nbsp; The tests require at least and HTML 4.0 browser in order to
              view the reference samples as they are presented in HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
              The reference pages are rendered using plain HTML plus style sheets.&nbsp; The
              test pages should render just like the reference pages.&nbsp; The links below
              will load the two pages within frames in your browser such that you can see the
              test page and reference page at the same time.

                      <b style="color: red;">Safari</b> - tested and mostly not working.&nbsp; For the same reason
                      that the styles don't render correctly in <a href="test2.html">Test&nbsp;#2</a>, the JavaScript
                      is not executed.&nbsp; It is interesting in that the page should look just like the page
                      in <a href="test1.html">Test&nbsp;#1</a> only this page is generated from XML via client
                      side XSLT and this causes the URL reference problems and JavaScript execution problems.&nbsp;
                      <i><b>Note:</b> it is the lack of correct path behavior that causes some of these
                      problems.&nbsp; It seems that the base path is not that of the document/frame but of the

              Notes on the browsers I have tested:

              <li>
                <b>Mozilla</b> includes all Mozilla technology based browsers including Firefox,
                Camino, etc.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Windows-IE</b> is IE6.&nbsp; This is the default browser that came with Windows XP.&nbsp;
                My Testing was done on Windows XP with Service Pack 2 installed.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Safari</b> is Mac OSX 10.3.9 release and 10.4 release.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Opera</b> is the Linux generic build of 8.0 Final.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-size: 120%;">
              What this means is that currently, only Mozilla/Firefox/etc and Windows-IE comply with the standards
              enough to use the Insurrection tools.&nbsp; This does, however, cover over 98% of the browsers
              in use.
