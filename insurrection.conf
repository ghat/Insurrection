# configure Insurrection & Subversion for apache without much or
# any change to the standard apache configuration file.

## The logformat that I use for Insurrection.  Note that this looks just like
## the traditional extended log but I want to be sure of the format so I
## enforce/repeat it here
LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" insurrection
